abstract = {This chapter introduces the Fourier method, which was named after a French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier, who introduced this type of method to study heat transfer. The basic idea of this method was to express complicated functions as the infinite sum of sine and cosine waves. We saw in the previous chapters that we can decompose a function using the Taylor series, which expresses the function with an infinite sum of polynomials. The Fourier method has many applications in engineering and science, such as signal processing, partial differential equations, image processing, etc. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was chosen as one of the top ten algorithms with the greatest influence on the development and practice of science and engineering in the 20th century in the January/February 2000 issue of Computing in Science and Engineering. Given its influence, this chapter is devoted to an introduction of the Fourier transform, with more focus on the signal processing, a topic very relevant science and engineering. By the end of this chapter, you should know the basics of the Fourier transform, as well as how to perform simple signal analysis using it.}
